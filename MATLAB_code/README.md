# Hybrid SUSD-based Appraoch to  Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Task Allocation Game
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of "Game-theoretical Approach to Multi-robot Task Allocation Using a Bio-inspired Optimization Strategy", which was presented in IROS 2023.

## Usage
There are three folders:
- **utility funcs**: contians all functions for ploting and path planning. 
- **MRTA_game_NE**: cosnider the code for Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. Simply run **main_NE.m**.
