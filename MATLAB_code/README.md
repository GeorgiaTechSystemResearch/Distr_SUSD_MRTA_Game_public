This is the MATLAB implementation of “Hybrid SUSD-based Task Allocation for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Teams”.

## Usage
There are three folders:
- **utility funcs**: contians all functions for ploting and path planning. 
- **MRTA_game_NE**: code for Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. Simply run **main_NE.m** to start.  
- **underwater_survey**: scneraio for underwater survey with a team of H-AUV and L-AUV. Simply run **main.m** to start.  

Results will be stored in the **results** folder in **MRTA_game_NE** and **underwater_survey**.
